      Simultaneously, I'm studying

      Over multiple internships, I have worked in various roles across different industries, contributing my skills while also learning new things from each - from app development to all things data!
      I love to work on things that create meaningful impact in people's lives and leverage tech for good and briefly even worked on the Android
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aetheria/id1028767781/" target="_blank">Aetheria</a> app for 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.withastra.org/" target="_blank">Astra Labs</a> a gen-z run non-profit.

      Outside of work and school, I'm probably coffee cupping at new cafes, messing with music production and DJing,
      or pursuing my endeavour of learning Japanese!

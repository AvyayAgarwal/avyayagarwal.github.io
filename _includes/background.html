      I went to school at the
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">University of Waterloo</a> for  
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://uwaterloo.ca/economics/" target="_blank">Economics</a> 
      and  I'm currently owning and working on building and scaling the permission and content platform at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.moveworks.com/" target="_blank">Moveworks</a>!
    </p>

      Outside of work, I'm probably coffee cupping at new cafes, messing with music production and DJing,
      or pursuing my endeavour of learning Japanese!
